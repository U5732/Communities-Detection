Communities-Detection
=====================

R implementation of (slightly modified) algorithm for unfolding graph communities with resolution as described in http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.1770v3 .

To use the algorithm prepare a matrix of (nonnegatively weighted) vertex incidence with rownames or paired data (matrix or table) consisting of 3 columns of the form (node1,node2,weight). Then run the function Communities_Resolution /see the description alongside the code/.
